# Kolibri Tech Vision

This is the web site where we describe the way do and aspire to do things when it comes to programming. To develop the site locally do this after you have checkout the repository:

```
$ npm install
$ gulp serve
```
open ```http://localhost:8000``` and you should see the site in all its glory ;)

After you are happy with your changes you can deploy them to the live site by doing this:

```$ gulp build && gulp deploy```

Happy hacking!
